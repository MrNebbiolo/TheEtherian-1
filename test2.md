    > settled shares, but the order book would be as fast as whatever
    > off-chain mechanism is running it."

##### [Casper](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/) (Dev Channel) – Proof of Stake Protocol

-   VItalik's formula for Casper protocol utility (the idea behind this
    is to penalize validators quadratically rather than linearly, which
    more naturally fits how they are adversely impacting the utility of
    the protocol): &gt;"U = E\[log(t\_finalized - t\_sent))\] where
    t\_sent is that time a transaction is sent, t\_finalized is the time
    that it is finalized, and E is expected value"
-   Note: Vlad and Vitalik had a really detailed (long) and informative
    conversation on the above protocol utility ideas, I'd reccomend
    scrolling up on the Gitter channel and reading the whole thing.

    > of dgx 2.0. That's when u can start pledging dgds on proposals and
    > receiving dgx as a reward for the work done for digixdao."

-   &gt;KC Chng: "There will be a coin lock mechanism for the quarterly pledges, if they are not locked, it would mean they are transferable and have not participated in curating the proposals. Hence those dgds have not participated in the proposals, and hence no fees are due to those dgds."
