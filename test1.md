##### [Casper](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/01/introducing-casper-friendly-ghost/) (Dev Channel) – Proof of Stake Protocol
- VItalik's formula for Casper protocol utility (the idea behind this is to penalize validators quadratically rather than linearly, which more naturally fits how they are adversely impacting the utility of the protocol): 
  >"U = E[log(t_finalized - t_sent))] where t_sent is that time a transaction is sent, t_finalized is the time that it is finalized, and E is expected value"
- Note: Vlad and Vitalik had a really detailed (long) and informative conversation on the above protocol utility ideas, I'd reccomend scrolling up on the Gitter channel and reading the whole thing.
